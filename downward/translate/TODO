Improve architecture:
* Axioms should be a special kind of operator, not an entity proper.
* Complicated goals should be replaced by simple goals (one fact only).
  This can be done via axioms.

Complete features:
* Conjunctive effects cannot appear inside universal or conditional effects;
  in general, the allowed effect structure is maybe too restrictive.
  For example, the "middle-compiled/adl" bit of the PSR domain is problematic
  because it has two effects with the same quantifiers and condition.
  Fix: Implement arbitrary nestings of and/forall/when.
